9.
	1)	try to initialize 5 of const int array with 3, 1, 6, 0, 2
	2)	get a next iterator of it, but the next iterator didn't use
	3)	try to assign 7 into it, but it caused compile error because it is const iterator
	4)	store a value that stored in it into local int variable which named i
	5)	Declare a new const int vector which named vc but it cause compile error because const int should be initialized with declaration
	6)	same issue with 3rd line, cause compile error too.
	7)	get a const begin iterator of ca and store in it. However, it faild because there is no matched operator between iterator and const iterator
	8)	Try to assign 7 into a value of it2
	9)	get a const begin iterator of v2 and assign it into auto variable which named cit
	10)	Try to assign 7 into a value of cit. However, it caused compile error because cit is a const iterator even though v2 is not a const vector or vector that contains any const value.
